# blackjack-in-javascript
Learning javascript by making a basic blackjack game

Concepts Explored
- Arrays
- Objects
- Variable types (boolean)
- logical statements
- loops
- Math Object (Random mainly)
- returning from functions

Most of these things I already know from Python and C++ but learning them in a new language is always fun
The main take from this was learning about == vs === which I feel might slip me up switching between python at work and javascript in my personal time
